# <Horiseon Social Solution Services Code Refactor>

## Description

The goal of this project was to become familiar with refactoring pre-existing code in order to improve the website's accessibility and to ensure the structure of the code itself is logical and efficient.

This website was designed to serve as a landing page for the fictional group, Horiseon Social Solution Services. On this webpage users can learn the importance of search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing. Users can also find tips to be successful in the world of online business advertising by reading the lead generation, brand awareness, and cost management sections on the side bar.

In undergoing this project, I was challenged to look at a large amount of pre-written code and break it down step by step in order to consolidate the CSS and HTML while maintaining the original styles. I was also able to familiarize myself with adding accessibility features such as alt text, as well as adding comments to my code to improve readability for future programmers who may work on the website.
